# Presentation
I recently presented something on Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) at work - they were fairly introductory slides and they are by no means an authority on the topic, but I did draw a lot of fun cat pics and I felt they were worth sharing somewhere. I think that's what the blog is for! 

More details and links stored in the slide notes for those who are interested.
