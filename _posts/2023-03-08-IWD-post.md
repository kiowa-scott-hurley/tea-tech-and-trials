# What's this post?

I was invited to talk to a group of high-school students for International Women's Day at [Casey Tech School](https://www.caseytechschool.vic.edu.au/pages/home.aspx) in 2023. 
I invite you to check out the slides I presented for this event if you're interested, but all content will be covered below in a similar format.
